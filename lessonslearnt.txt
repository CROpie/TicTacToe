const moduleName = (() => {

    return { }
})();

This will make the module run as soon as the (window is loaded?) 
That means that variables like < const variable = 47;> will be able to be accessed immediately
Even something like < const playerList = theGrid.createPlayers(); > will be able to be accessed immediately
(requires the return { }, as well as the extra 2 sets of parentheses at the start/end)

EventListener was making things go out of turn, and leading to not defined errors, since "playerList" was being
defined when the start button was pressed.
To solve this, an empty playerList was first declared in the object, and it was populated at a later stage.
